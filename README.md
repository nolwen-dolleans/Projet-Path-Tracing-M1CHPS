# Monte Carlo Path Tracing
A path tracer using Monte Carlo for image rendering written in C.



## Installation

### Build 
```bash
   cmake -B build
   make -C build
   ```

### Run 
```bash
    mkdir -p image
    mkdir -p performance
    mkdir -p performance/measures

    export BOUNCES=number_of_bounces #(optional; = 26 by default)
    ./build/ppm width height amount_of_sample 
```



## Experiments
We focus our study on runtime optimization.
Two experimental protocols are used:
   - runtime measurement
	- convergence speed measurement

Some optimizations that reduce runtime can negatively impact convergence speed.

### Protocol 1: The runtime

#### Objective
The goal of this experiment is to measure the performances of the Path Tracer by focusing on the runtime. It will be measured only on the rendering phase, not the scene initialization and the time computation neather. 

#### Requierment
   - Compiler: gcc / clang
   - CMake
   - mpich 4.3.0

#### Setup
Build the project in Release mode:
   ```bash
   cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   make -C build
   ```
   - Image resolution: WxH
   - Number of samples: N
   - Number of bounces: B
   - Benchmark scene: either homemade or predefined

#### Time Measurement
Runtime measurement is implemented directly in the path tracer using:
```c
clock_gettime();
```
The function is called twice:
```c
struct timespec start, end;

clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &start);

/* rendering computation */

clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &end);
```

Runtime measurements are exported to:
```code
performance/measures/runtime_by_samplings.csv
```
All runtimes are stored in seconds.

Run the experiment:
```bash
   export BOUNCES=b
   mpirun -n "number of mpi processes" ./build/ppm W H N
   ```

By default, the executable generates:
   - one rendered image
   - one runtime measurement
To perform multiple measurements during a single execution, use:
 ```bash
   mpirun -n "number of mpi processes" ./build/ppm W H N number_of_measures
   ```
where number_of_measures specifies how many measurements are taken between 1 and N samples.

To generate only the final image instead of all intermediate images, use "no_image" option.

Example:
```bash
export BOUNCES=10
mpirun -n 4 ./build/ppm 800 600 1000 100 no_image
```
